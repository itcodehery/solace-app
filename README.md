## The Problem
Mental health issues are prevalent and often stigmatized, leading many individuals to suffer in silence. Existing social media platforms lack the focused support and resources needed to effectively address mental well-being. Users need a dedicated space where they can track their moods, access professional advice, engage in wellness activities, and connect with a supportive community without fear of judgment or privacy breaches.

## The Solution
Solace is a gamified mental wellness app that provides users with a safe and supportive environment to track their moods, complete daily wellness challenges, and engage with a community of like-minded individuals. Users can complete challenges, post online anonymously, track their mood and more. Solace also offers a range of resources, including professional advice and wellness activities, to help users improve their mental well-being.
